# Bank-Loan-Analysis
Analyzed bank loan data to identify factors affecting approvals and defaults using SQL, Power BI, and Excel. Cleaned and explored customer data, visualized trends, and found that good credit history, stable employment, and higher income improve loan approval chances and reduce risks. This helps lenders make data-driven loan decisions.
